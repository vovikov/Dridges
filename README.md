Welcome to the source page for Seven Bridges.

For years, residents tried to cross every bridge without crossing any of them more than once.

This project is an Ipad and iPhone game based on these famous bridges. Each level is a puzzle with bridges to cross, home to visit, and sometimes coins to collect.
